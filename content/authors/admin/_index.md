I am a Ph.D. candidate at [NIDI](https://nidi.nl/en/). In my Ph.D. dissertation supervised by [Prof. Dr. Matthijs Kalmijn](https://matthijskalmijn.nl/)  and [Prof. Dr. Helga de Valk](https://nidi.nl/en/employees/helga-de-valk/), I investigate the consequences of early parental death for partners and children. Before working at NIDI, I completed my Research Master's degree in Sociology and Social Research at Utrecht University. In my Master's thesis supervised by [Dr. Deni Mazrekaj](https://denimazrekaj.com/), I investigated the association between parenthood and health of people in same-sex and different-sex relationships. 

I am particularly interested in family diversity, gender and sexuality, and quantitative methods. Please free to contact me and follow my work.
