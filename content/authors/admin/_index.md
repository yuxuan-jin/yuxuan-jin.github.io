I am a Ph.D. candidate at NIDI-KNAW/University of Groningen. My doctoral research is on consequences of parental death for partners and children supervised by Prof. Dr. Matthijs Kalmijn and Prof. Dr. Helga de Valk. This project is a part of the KNAW funded project "The Early Death of a Parent: Multigenerational Analyses of Patterns and Consequences". Before working at NIDI, I completed my Research Master's degree in Sociology and Social Research at Utrecht University. My Master's thesis is on parenthood and health of people in same-sex and different-sex relationships supervised by Dr. Deni Mazrekaj. 

I am particularly interested in family diversity, gender & sexuality, and quantitative methods. Please free to contact me and follow my work.
